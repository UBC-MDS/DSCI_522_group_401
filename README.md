## Project Proposal: Medical Expenses Prediction

### Data Source

The [Data](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/meperezcuello/82a9f1c1c473d6585e750ad2e3c05a41/raw/d42d226d0dd64e7f5395a0eec1b9190a10edbc03/Medical_Cost.csv) we are using for this analysis is used in the book Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz; which is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. All of these datasets are in the public domain. The data explain the cost of a small sample of USA population Medical Insurance Cost based on attributes like age, sex, number of children etc. Additional information about this data can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/meperezcuello/82a9f1c1c473d6585e750ad2e3c05a41).

### Research Question

For this project we are working on the following main predictive research question

> Our research question is "given a person's information, what would be his/her predicted medical expenses?"

Throughout this project we also want to investigate two more inferential sub-questions

- Is there a significant difference of expenses between smokers and non-smokers? (inferential - We would do a two-side hypothesis test)
- Is there a significant difference of expenses between males and females? (inferential - We would do a two-side hypothesis test)


### Analysis Plan
Make a plan of how you will analyze the data (report an estimate and confidence intervals? hypothesis test? classification with a decision tree?). Choose something you already know how to do (report an estimate and confidence intervals, a two-group hypothesis, linear regression, classification with a decision tree, etc).

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Discuss at least one exploratory data analysis table and one exploratory data analysis figure you will create that makes sense for your research question, the data that you have, and the analysis you plan to do.

### Results of Analysis
Suggest how you would share the results of your analysis as one or more tables and/or figures.
